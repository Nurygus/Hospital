How the system works:
1. Patient's letter goes first to his family doctor.
2. If the family doctor decides to send the patient to the hospital after performing the necessary tests, he forwards the letter to the hospital.
3. The letter from the hospital is addressed to the doctors who perform special reception work. These doctors refer the letter to the most appropriate doctor at the hospital.
4. The letter goes to the doctor and the doctor informs the patient when to come to him.

The doctor presses a button and the patient's card is in the palm of the doctor's hand.
The doctor selects the patient whose card he wants from the list of patients belonging to him. The patient's card is made in the form of a list of records. Each record belongs to a structure. Structures are a type of records that are used to standardize and organize the patient's chart. Each record has a title, content, name of the doctor who performed it, and the time it was performed.

The doctor can create a record by selecting the required structure with the buttons on the right side of the screen.
